# Prithivkrishna K B - Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This repository contains the source code for my digital space, built from scratch to showcase my projects, skills, and background.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an **Electrical Engineering** student at **IIT Palakkad** with a strong passion for bridging the gap between hardware and software. I built this site to document my journey in:
* Web Development
* Game Development
* Robotics
* Tech Exploration

## 🚀 Features

* **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile screens.
* **Smooth Navigation:** Smooth scrolling between sections (Home, About, Projects, Skills, Contact).
* **Interactive UI:** Custom hover animations on the navigation bar and project cards.
* **Clean Styling:** a dark-themed aesthetic using a custom color palette (Chartreuse & Dark Grey).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structure and semantic layout.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox, Grid, and custom animations (`header.css`, `home.css`, `general.css`).
* **Google Fonts:** Typography using the "Comfortaa" font family.
